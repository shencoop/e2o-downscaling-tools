This example for the rhine takes about 20 minutes to run and will create about 
230Mb of data.

1) use the runrad.bat or runrad_4cpu.bat file (on windows) to run the example. 
The maps are saved in the output_rad dir.

2) run the runevap.bat file to download the WDFEI forcing data from the earth2observe 
server and calculate reference ET (susing the radiation maps to correct for the DEM).
